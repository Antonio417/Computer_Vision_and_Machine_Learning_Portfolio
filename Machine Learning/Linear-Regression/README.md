# ðŸ“ˆ Linear Regression
Description: Regression is a statistical method that attempts to determine the strength and character of the relationship between one dependent variable (usually denoted by Y or 'label' in machine learning) and a series of other variables (known as independent variables). Linear regression attempts to find the line (or a more complex linear combination) that most closely fits the data according to a specific mathematical criterion. In layman terms, it tries to find the line of best fit in a 2D data.
Expected result is to get an equation for a line of best fit as shown below
