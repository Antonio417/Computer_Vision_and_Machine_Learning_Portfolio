# ðŸ¤– Detecting Character
Description: Convolutional Neural Networks are well known for providing solutions for classification task. This project was done to compare and understand how change in architecture of these networks affects their performance. I also investigated other pre-trained model such as VGG16 and compare these model with the base model.
