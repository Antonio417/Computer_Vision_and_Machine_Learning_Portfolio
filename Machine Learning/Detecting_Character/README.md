# ðŸ¤– Detecting Character
Description: Convolutional Neural Networks are well known for providing solutions for classification task. This project was done to compare and understand how change in architecture of these networks affects their performance. I also investigated other pre-trained model such as VGG16 and compare these model with the base model.

## Pre-Processing
The data initially had 43 classes with an unequal distribution in the amount of images for each classes. This means that some of the classes will have more images in them than others. This is could lead to bias in our classification model because the model have a better accuracy for classes with more images. To solve this, I removed some of the classes that have less than 150 images in them since it is more advantageous to have at least 100 images in a class in order to get good results from our model. The final dataset that was used for training and testing have only 20 classes where in each classes there are more than 150 images.
