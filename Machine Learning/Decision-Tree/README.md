# ðŸŒ² Decision Tree 
Description: A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a test on a feature (e.g. whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails) , 
each leaf node represents a class label (decision taken after computing all features) and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. 
The paths from root to leaf represent classification rules. Below diagram illustrate the basic flow of decision tree for decision making with labels (Rain(Yes), No Rain(No)).
