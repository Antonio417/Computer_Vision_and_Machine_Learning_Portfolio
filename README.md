| Project Name | Area | Description | Libraries | 
|---|---|---|---|
| Sobel Filter | Image Filtering and Edge Detection | This project makes use of a sobel filter to perform edge detection. This project was also done to have a better understanding on how to perform edge detection manually without using any pre-existing frameworks. Below was the result obtain from this project. |  
| Convolutional Neural Networks | Image Classification | This project makes use of a CNN model to classify images from the public CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consist of random images where each image can be classified into 10 classes or categories. The CNN model will be trained and tested by using this dataset to be able to classify new images into 1 of these 10 models. The 10 classes in the dataset are one hot encoded for ease of use and understanding.| TensorFlow, Keras, Numpy, Matplotlib.|
<!--- I achieved this by performing all of the necessary calculation manually without making use of any pre-existing libraries. The magnitude and orientation of the gradients was calculated manually by doing convolution with a 3x3 filter in the horizontal and vertical direction in order to detect all edges no matter the orientation of it was. Non-maximal suppresion was also done in order to remove noise pixel within the image for better resolution. --->
