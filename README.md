# Computer Vision 
#### Libraries: Pytorch, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Numpy and Sklearn
| Project Name | Area | Description | Libraries | 
|---|---|---|---|
| [K-Means Clustering on Image](https://github.com/Antonio417/Computer_Vision_and_Machine_Learning_Portfolio/tree/main/Computer%20Vision/K-means) | Centroid-Based Clustering | This project was done to better understand how K-Means and K-means++ clustering can be done on an image. K-means is an unsupervised learning model where the dataset has no data to class pair like what we have in a classification problem. The model will have to find clusters or pattern within the data by itself. The result of this project is as shown below. First image shows expected result, second image shows image after clustering it with four initial random centroids and third image show the final image after K-Means clustering for 5 iteration![Kmeans](https://github.com/Antonio417/Computer_Vision_and_Machine_Learning_Portfolio/blob/main/Computer%20Vision/K-means/img/objective.png) ![image1](https://github.com/Antonio417/Computer_Vision_and_Machine_Learning_Portfolio/blob/main/Computer%20Vision/K-means/img/img1.png)![image2](https://github.com/Antonio417/Computer_Vision_and_Machine_Learning_Portfolio/blob/main/Computer%20Vision/K-means/img/img2.png)| Numpy, cv2, Matplotlib and Pyplot |
| [Image Stitching](https://github.com/Antonio417/Computer_Vision_and_Machine_Learning_Portfolio/tree/main/Computer%20Vision/Image_Stitching) | Projective Geometry and Use of Homography Matrix | This project main aim was to be able to stitch two or more images of the same landscape that are taken at different angle, height and lighting into one long image. The output image expected was an image that is similar to a panoramic image. The output of this project is as shown below. The first two image are the initial image that are taken at a different angle compared to the other one. The last image is the stitched image. ![left](https://github.com/Antonio417/Computer_Vision_and_Machine_Learning_Portfolio/blob/main/Computer%20Vision/Image_Stitching/left.jpg)![right](https://github.com/Antonio417/Computer_Vision_and_Machine_Learning_Portfolio/blob/main/Computer%20Vision/Image_Stitching/right.jpg)![Image Stitching](https://github.com/Antonio417/Computer_Vision_and_Machine_Learning_Portfolio/blob/main/Computer%20Vision/Image_Stitching/Stitched_Image_Adjust_Brightness.jpg) | Numpy, cv2, Matplotlib and Pyplot |
| [Sobel Filter](https://github.com/Antonio417/Computer_Vision_and_Machine_Learning_Portfolio/tree/main/Computer%20Vision/Sobel_filter) | Image Filtering and Edge Detection | This project was done to help us understand how to build a **Canny Edge Detector** from scratch by using a sobel filter and investigate how to perform these tasks manually without using any pre-existing frameworks. Below was the result obtained from this project.![Computer Vision](https://github.com/Antonio417/Computer_Vision_and_Machine_Learning_Portfolio/blob/main/Computer%20Vision/Sobel_filter/Visuals/sobel_filter_result.png) | Numpy, cv2 and Matplotlib |

# Machine Learning 
#### Libraries: Numpy, Matplotlib and Sklearn
#### Projects shown below were done to better understand machine learning or deep learning models and investigate the application of these models to solve real-life problems.
| Model Name | Description | 
|---|---|
| [Linear Regression](https://github.com/Antonio417/Computer_Vision_and_Machine_Learning_Portfolio/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/Linear-Regression) | Regression is a statistical method that attempts to determine the strength and character of the relationship between one dependent variable (usually denoted by Y or 'label' in machine learning) and a series of other variables (known as independent variables). Linear regression attempts to find the line (or a more complex linear combination) that most closely fits the data according to a specific mathematical criterion. Result is as shown below. <img src = "https://github.com/Antonio417/Computer_Vision_and_Machine_Learning_Portfolio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Linear-Regression/Linear_Regression.png" width=500 height=420>
| [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/Antonio417/Computer_Vision_and_Machine_Learning_Portfolio/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/Logistic-Regression) | Logistic Regression attempts to find the probability of an event taking place by having the log-odds for the event be a linear combination of one or more independent variables. Logistic Regression is fitting the line values to the sigmoid curve. Loss Function for Logistic Regression is the Cross Entropy. Result is as shown below ![img1](https://github.com/Antonio417/Computer_Vision_and_Machine_Learning_Portfolio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Logistic-Regression/result.jpeg)
| [K-Nearest Neighbor](https://github.com/Antonio417/Computer_Vision_and_Machine_Learning_Portfolio/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/KNN) | KNN is a supervised learning classifier which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point. The process of this algorithm is as shown below <img src = "https://github.com/Antonio417/Computer_Vision_and_Machine_Learning_Portfolio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/KNN/KNN-Classification.gif" width=550 height=420>
| [Support Vector Machine](https://github.com/Antonio417/Computer_Vision_and_Machine_Learning_Portfolio/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/SVM) | The objective of the support vector machine algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space(N â€” the number of features) that distinctly classifies the data points. |
| [Decision Tree](https://github.com/Antonio417/Computer_Vision_and_Machine_Learning_Portfolio/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/Decision-Tree) | A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a test on a feature (e.g. whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails) , each leaf node represents a class label (decision taken after computing all features) and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels.
