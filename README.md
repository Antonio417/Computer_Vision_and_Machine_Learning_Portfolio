| Project Name | Area | Description | Libraries | 
|---|---|---|---|
| Sobel Filter | Image Filtering and Edge Detection | This project was done to build a sobel filter to perform edge detection and investigate how to perform these tasks manually without using any pre-existing frameworks. Below was the result obtained from this project after non-maximal suppresion was done.![Computer Vision](https://github.com/Antonio417/Computer_Vision_and_Machine_Learning_Portfolio/blob/main/Computer%20Vision/Sobel_filter/sobel_filter_result.png) | Numpy, cv2 and Matplotlib |
| Image Stitching | Homographies | This project main aim was to be able to stitch two or more images of the same landscape that are taken at different angle, height and lighting into one long image. The output image expected was an image that is similar to a panoramic image. The output of this project is as shown below. The first two image are the initial image that are taken at a different angle, height and lighting compared to the other one. The last image is the stitched image. ![left](https://github.com/Antonio417/Computer_Vision_and_Machine_Learning_Portfolio/blob/main/Computer%20Vision/Image_Stitching/left.jpg)![right](https://github.com/Antonio417/Computer_Vision_and_Machine_Learning_Portfolio/blob/main/Computer%20Vision/Image_Stitching/right.jpg)![Image Stitching](https://github.com/Antonio417/Computer_Vision_and_Machine_Learning_Portfolio/blob/main/Computer%20Vision/Image_Stitching/Stitched_Image_Adjust_Brightness.jpg) | Numpy, cv2, Matplotlib and Pyplot |
| K-Means Clustering on Image | Centroid-Based Clustering | This project was done to better understand how K-Means clustering can be done on an image. K-Means is an unsupervised learning model since the dataset has no data to class pair. So input to the model is just raw data and the model have to make clusters based on the pre-determined amount of centroids needed. This model can be implemented in other computer vision tasks such as image segmentation since we can segment images based on the colour or even the brightness of certain pixel. The result of this project is as shown below.| Numpy, cv2, Matplotlib and Pyplot |  
| Convolutional Neural Networks | Image Classification | This project makes use of a CNN model to classify images from the public CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consist of random images where each image can be classified into 10 classes or categories. The CNN model will be trained and tested by using this dataset to be able to classify new images into 1 of these 10 models. The 10 classes in the dataset are one hot encoded for ease of use and understanding.| TensorFlow, Keras, Numpy, Matplotlib.|
<!--- I achieved this by performing all of the necessary calculation manually without making use of any pre-existing libraries. The magnitude and orientation of the gradients was calculated manually by doing convolution with a 3x3 filter in the horizontal and vertical direction in order to detect all edges no matter the orientation of it was. Non-maximal suppresion was also done in order to remove noise pixel within the image for better resolution. --->
